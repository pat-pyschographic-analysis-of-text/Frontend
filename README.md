## Project summary 

### Why interesting 
- What do my tweets actually say about me? About to enter job hunt, curious about positivity, etc. 
- Analyzing a lot of text, seemed like big challenge: also deal with large body of data 
- Wanted to work with data scientists; thought that psychographic analysis interesting for machine learning 

## Thought I knew X 
- Components vs. Pages and views (we actually need views and pages!)
- Thought backend would be easier; getting data; getting transferred to translate data to make the graphs. 

## Was actually Y 
- Views matter, too!
